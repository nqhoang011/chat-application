# Chat Application

A real-time chat backend built with Spring Boot, using WebSockets for instant messaging, PostgreSQL for reliable storage of users, conversations, and message history, and Kafka for scalable event streaming and message delivery. The system provides secure authentication, efficient message persistence, user presence tracking, and supports horizontal scaling through Kafka-based decoupled communication and distributed processing.
